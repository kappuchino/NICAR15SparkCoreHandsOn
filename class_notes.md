#Class notes

**What we're going to cover today:**

* What's in the box
* The setup steps we're skipping over
* The Hello World of the hardware world: Making a light blink
* Thermometer, wires and the Core
* The code we'll need
* Now we connect the dots -- Spark to IFTTT to Google


###What's in the box###

* Check out the Core itself, and the breadboard
* What is a breadboard? 
* Wires, capacitors, sensors oh my


###The setup we're skipping###

* Each core must be "claimed" by an account
* That's the secret sauce behind the connections
* Thus, you're accounts have already been created

###Hello World###

* In the IDE on Spark.io, find the Blink an LED example
* Familiarize yourself with the buttons on the left
* Fork the example
* Change the delay
* Congrats! You're a hardware hacker now.

###Thermometer, wires and the Core###

* First, find the thermometer
* Getting power to the thermometer
* Connecting the signal wire
* That's it? Yep. Three wires and the truth.

###The Code###

* Follow along with the code on the screen. 
* The same code is in this repository as well.

###Connecting the dots###

* Create an IFTTT account if you haven't already.
* Search for Spark and [find one that logs events in Google Drive](https://ifttt.com/recipes/244508-log-events-in-google-drive).
* Add your Spark account to it (your username and password have been provided) and connect your Google Account to it (you can use your own or you can use the one created for this class).
* The event name is temperature -- you'll add that in the recipe

###Finishing up###

* Power up the Core and load the software on there if you haven't already.
* What's wrong? 
* Analog signals, noise and how to deal with it.


**Last step: Stand in awe of what you have done. Imagine the possibilities.**
