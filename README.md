#NICAR15 Spark Core Hands On

Class notes and materials for a NICAR 2015 hands-on class using a Spark Core, IFTTT and Google Spreadsheets to record temperature every 10 minutes. 

For this, you'll need:

* A [Spark Maker Kit](https://store.spark.io/?product=spark-maker-kit). I used the Core, but the Photon will work as well if you can get it. They were sold out at the time of this class.
* An account at [Spark.io](http://www.spark.io)
* An [IFTTT account](https://ifttt.com/).
* [This IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/244508-log-events-in-google-drive)
* A Google Drive account.
